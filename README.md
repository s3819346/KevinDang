									<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
									<p>I have always been a tech addict since I was a child, my dad who is an enthusiast teach me a lot about technology and how it could have a great impact in the future and that gives me a tremendous passion to pursue this major. I regularly get to lay my hands on the newest technology and to understand the mechanisms of how things work.</p> 
									<p>In today's world, there is a lot of problems that relate to information leakage and that creates a huge exposure of user's data on the Internet unintentionally or sometimes on purpose. It could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data about a person's life, address, phone numbers or where do they live. Perhaps have a greater impact if a company's private project or design gets expose online, it would cause a lot of damage to the company's reputation. Therefore, I think it is my duty to pursue cybersecurity, it demonstates how we can avoid and counter if someone is trying to exploit the data and then prevent that from happening.</p>
									<p>The reason why I chose RMIT Saigon is that the infrastructure of this university is the best there is, and also studying in the international environment prepares me with a lot of useful skills and helps to elevate my communication skills. And there is a great chance that after you finish the program you have better opportunities than students at other universities in Vietnam.</p>
									<p>After the Bachelor of IT course, I hope that I could be more confident and have no problem with coding and understand all about the coding language that I need, also an improvement of my lack of communication and social skills.</p>

									<h3>Personal profile</h3>
									<p>I think that the results from the 16PersonalitiesTest are fairly accurate and it shows that I am a Mediator which is an introvert, an intuitive type of person and also has a turbulent personality but only when it reaches the limit. This makes Mediators became such a distinct character in comparison to others, which sometimes they could be misunderstood. However, when they find like-minded people who they can relate to, you can think of Mediators as a friend who is full of entertainment and inspiration. 
Working in a group with a Mediator can be difficult at first but and may take a while to fit in but when they do fit in, they will cooperate smoothly with the team. As for myself, I think I will listen to other people's ideas in the group before jumping into a conclusion.</p>
